# Low-cost-ventilator-
This paper presents the codes for the design and development of a low-cost ventilator intended for emergency situations and resource-constrained environments. The ventilator is engineered to deliver breaths within a range of 5 to 30 per minute through a pulley and lever mechanism driven by an electromagnetic stepper motor, drawing power from a 12V supply. 
Offering flexibility, the device provides a tidal 
volume output ranging from 400ml to 1000ml and an adjustable inspiration to expiration ratio 
of 1:3, which can be tailored to meet individual patient requirements. To enhance usability, 
the ventilator is equipped with an LCD screen user interface that displays the set tidal 
volume, breaths per minute, and inspiration to expiration time ratio. Additionally, the system 
is equipped with two pressure sensors integrated into the patient connector, enabling precise 
measurements of flow rate and pressure changes in the oxygen delivery tube. Ensuring 
reliability, the device has been carefully calibrated to maintain a 10% accuracy rate in 
delivering the set output. This prototype showcases the potential of automated Ambu bag 
compression, offering a cost-effective and portable ventilator system that delivers essential 
ventilation features, rivaling existing technology at a significantly reduced cost.
